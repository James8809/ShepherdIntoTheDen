# ShepherdIntoTheDen
Shepherd Into The Den is a game project I joined for about 3 months during srping quarter in my final year at UCSC for my course cpmp172. After the course I spent some more time to brush up the project with assets from the original team and end up with a simple prototype for the game. The game was made by unity and has a team of 10 people inluding me when I joined. The game is a short 3D Isometric RPG featuring a sheep hero been asked by Osiria, the sheep goddess to save the sheep community from the evil wolves. Player will play as the sheep hero named Patch and go on an adventure to rescue the sheeps. The game features combats with a few enemies, a crafting system, abilities, and stunning art.
